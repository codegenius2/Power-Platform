# AI Builder Invoice Processing Automation Starter Kit

AI Builder Invoice Processing Automation Starter Kit is a reference implementation of invoice processing automation provided by Microsoft to bootstrap your implementation.

This is an installation package including two Power Automate flows orchestrating the processing of invoices with AI Builder, several Microsoft Dataverse entities to store the information, a role and a Power App to customize the starter kit and monitor the processing and edit missing or inaccurate extracted data. This is a role-based solution with ability isolate data by region.

We have also included a connector to invoices received by email, but you can enhance it with any connectors supported by Power Automate.

The starter kit is also available on Microsoft AppSource: <https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.aibuilder_invoiceprocessing_starterkit>
