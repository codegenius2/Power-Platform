# Bulk Operations Sample

This sample shows how to perform bulk create and update operations using several different approaches including the use of these classes:

- [CreateMultipleRequest](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.messages.createmultiplerequest)
- [UpdateMultipleRequest](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.messages.updatemultiplerequest) 
- [UpsertMultipleRequest](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.messages.upsertmultiplerequest)

Also, examples using elastic tables use the `DeleteMultiple` message without an SDK class.
 
These messages are optimized to provide the most performant way to create, update, or delete records with Dataverse.

This sample provides the option to use *standard* or *elastic* tables so you can compare the different performance characteristics.

This sample is a prerequisite for the [CreateMultiple and UpdateMultiple plug-ins Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/orgsvc/C%23/xMultiplePluginSamples)

This sample is a Visual Studio .NET 6.0 solution that contains 5 different projects that perform the same operations in different ways so that you can compare the performance of each method. 

> **NOTE**:
> The **UpsertMultiple** project is a little different. See the [UpsertMultiple/README.md](UpsertMultiple/README.md) for details.

You can find the sample [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/orgsvc/C%23-NETCore/BulkOperations).

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
- Access to Dataverse with system administrator or system customizer privileges.

## How to run this sample

1. Clone or download the [PowerApps-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples) repository.
1. Open the `PowerApps-Samples/dataverse/orgsvc/C#-NETCore/CreateUpdateMultiple/CreateUpdateMultiple.sln` file using Visual Studio 2022.
1. Edit the `appsettings.json` file. Set the connection string `Url` and `Username` parameters as appropriate for your test environment.
1. The environment Url can be found in the Power Platform admin center. It has the form `https://<environment-name>.crm.dynamics.com`.
1. Build the solution, select the desired project as the startup project and press F5 to run the console application in debug mode.

When the sample runs, you will be prompted in the default browser to select an environment user account and enter a password. To avoid having to do this every time you run a sample, insert a `Password` parameter into the connection string in the appsettings.json file. For example:

```json
{
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "default": "AuthType=OAuth;Url=https://myorg.crm.dynamics.com;Username=someone@myorg.onmicrosoft.com;Password=mypassword;RedirectUri=http://localhost;AppId=51f81489-12ee-4a9e-aaae-a2591f45987d;LoginPrompt=Auto"
  }
}
```
> **TIP**
> You can set a user environment variable named `DATAVERSE_APPSETTINGS` to the file path of the appsettings.json file stored anywhere on your computer. The samples will use that appsettings file if the environment variable exists and is not null. Be sure to log out and back in again after you define the variable for it to take affect. To set an environment variable, go to **Settings** > **System** > **About**, select **Advanced system settings**, and then choose **Environment variables**.

## What this sample does

This sample is a .NET 6.0 Visual Studio 2022 solution that contains 5 projects that perform the same operations:

1. Create a new custom table named `sample_example` if it doesn't already exist.
   
   The table will be created as a standard table by default. To create an elastic table, change the `UseElastic` property in `Settings.cs` to true.

1. Prepare a configurable number of entity instances for the custom table representing records to create.
1. Create the records. Each project uses a different method.
1. Update the set of entity instances that were created by appending text to the `sample_name` attribute.
1. Update the records using the same method they were created.
1. Delete the records.
   
   - If `Settings.UseElastic` is false, use the the `BulkDeleteRequest` to delete the records created and report on the success of this request.
   - Otherwise use the DeleteMultiple message when the table is an elastic table.

1. Delete the custom `sample_example` table created in the first step.

Each project uses a shared set of settings in the `Settings.cs` file that allow you to control:

- `UseElastic` : Whether to create and use an elastic table instead of a standard table.
- `NumberOfRecords` : The number of records to create. The default value is 100 but you can raise it to 1000 or higher.
- `StandardBatchSize` : The maximum number of records operations to send with `ExecuteMultiple`, `CreateMultiple`, and `UpdateMultiple`. `ExecuteMultiple` cannot exceed 1000.
- `ElasticBatchSize` : The recommended number of records operations to send with `CreateMultiple`, `UpdateMultiple` and `DeleteMultiple` for Elastic tables is 100. You can use a higher or lower number, but a higher batch size isn't necessarily going to provide higher throughput because there is no transaction with elastic tables.
- `BypassCustomPluginExecution` : Whether custom plug-in logic should be bypassed. This is useful to observe the performance impact of plug-ins registered on events for the table.
- `DeleteTable` : Whether to delete the custom `sample_example` table at the end of the sample. If you want to test plug-ins that use events on this table, this will preserve the table so you can run the samples multiple times while testing plug-ins.
- `CreateAlternateKey` : Used by the **UpsertMultiple** project only, it specifies whether an alternate key should be created with the table.

The `Settings.cs` file is included in each project. Apply the change in one project and they will be set for all of them.

### Supporting examples

The shared `Utility.cs` class contains static methods to perform operations that are common in each sample. These are not the primary focus of the sample, but might be of interest:

|Method  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|`TableExists`|Detects whether a table with the specified schema name exists.|
|`BulkDeleteRecordsByIds`|Asynchronously deletes a group of records for a specified table by id.|
|`IsMessageAvailable`|Detect whether a specified message is supported for the specified table.|
|`CreateExampleTable`|Creates the table used by projects in this solution if it doesn't already exist. Currently uses Web API to create elastic table.|
|`DeleteExampleTable`|Deletes the table used by projects in this solution, unless the `DeleteTable` setting is false.|

## How this sample works

By default the **CreateUpdateMultiple** project should be set as the startup project for the solution. To try any of the other samples, select the project in Solution Explorer and choose **Set as startup project**.

### Demonstrate

As mentioned in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does) above, 5 projects in this solution demonstrate how to create and update records in bulk for a custom table created by the sample. To do this, it must create a custom table and clean up when you finish running the sample.

Each project in this solution sends requests in the following way:

- Includes the optional `tag` parameter so that the name of the project is available to plug-ins as a shared variable.
- Depending on the settings, may include the optional `BypassCustomPluginExecution` parameter to disable custom plug-in execution so that the impact of any plug-ins registered for the operation can be compared.
- Has a [Stopwatch](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.stopwatch?view=net-6.0) configured to capture the total duration of seconds for the request to complete.

Details about each project and the default output are described in their respective README files:
